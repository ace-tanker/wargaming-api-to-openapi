      "description": "Generally open terrain featuring a large hill and a railway embankment. Scattered trees provide concealment for tank destroyers. On the offensive, strike against the enemy's flanks, but do not leave your own flanks unguarded. Artillery enjoys good fields of fire, but is still vulnerable to raids by light tanks.",

      "description": "A labyrinth of streets and squares, impassable for artillery and tank destroyers, but ideal for speedy breakthrough and bypass by medium and light tanks. Access roads running by the hill, with the castle that dominates the area, and along the railway lines can help you out of the impasse.",

      "description": "Generally open, this map allows you to strike in multiple directions, but don't disperse your forces too much. A road in the center will take you to the enemy base more directly, but perhaps with greater difficulty. The edges of the map may offer better avenues for attacks and feints.",
